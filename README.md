# rvolvr

*periodially changes my twitter banner with AI created art*

rvolvr is an art generator using a Wasserstein GAN, it is just a rewrite of the project by Kenny Jones and Derrick Bonafilia

using keras, something different yet the same. I am doing this as a learning exercise as there is alot going on and just reading the source code won't do. 

A good read on the original project

it is an creative outlet because the best we can do is stick figures, at least for me.
